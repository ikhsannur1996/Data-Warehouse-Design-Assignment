## Data Warehouse Design Assignment

### Objective:
Design a data warehouse (DWH) schema for either the Employee or Sales domain. Create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) representing the schema and describe it using either the star schema or snowflake schema. Provide detailed descriptions of the tables and columns involved. Finally, create three sample queries (Data Mart tables) from the DWH schema.

### Dataset Selection:
Choose one of the following datasets for your data warehouse design:
1. Employee SQL dataset
2. Sales SQL dataset

### Requirements:
1. **ERD Diagram:**
   - Create an ERD representing the chosen dataset's schema.
   - Clearly illustrate the relationships between tables.
   
2. **Schema Description:**
   - Describe the schema using either star schema or snowflake schema.
   - Provide explanations for each table, highlighting the primary key, foreign keys, and any important attributes.

3. **Sample Queries (Data Mart Tables):**
   - Create three Data Mart tables (sample queries) based on the designed schema.
   - Each Data Mart table should serve a specific analytical or reporting purpose.
   - Include SQL queries to generate these Data Mart tables.

### Deliverables:
1. **README.md**:
   - Provide an overview of the assignment and its objectives.
   - Include instructions on how to interpret the ERD diagram and schema description.
   - Explain the purpose of each Data Mart table and provide SQL queries to generate them.
   
2. **ERD Diagram Image**:
   - Attach an image of the ERD diagram in the README file.
   - Ensure the diagram is legible and clearly labeled.
   
3. **SQL Files**:
   - Include SQL files containing schema creation queries and sample queries for generating Data Mart tables.
   
### Submission Guidelines:
- Fork this repository and commit your solution.
- Ensure all files are properly named and organized.
- Double-check that your SQL queries are accurate and well-commented.
- Make sure your ERD diagram is clear and understandable.

### Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Accuracy and completeness of the schema design.
- Clarity and coherence of the ERD diagram.
- Depth and relevance of the schema description.
- Appropriateness and effectiveness of the Data Mart table queries.

### Deadline:
Submit your completed assignment by [insert deadline here]. Late submissions will not be accepted.

### Additional Notes:
- Feel free to use any tool or software for creating the ERD diagram.
- Ensure consistency in naming conventions and data types across tables and columns.
- Use appropriate primary and foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity.
- Consider scalability and performance optimization in your schema design.
- If you encounter any ambiguities or have questions, don't hesitate to ask for clarification.
